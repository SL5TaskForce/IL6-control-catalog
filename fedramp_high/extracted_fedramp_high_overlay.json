CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP\u2019s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. During monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item. CSPs are not required to map the findings to specific controls because controls are only assessed during initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests.",
